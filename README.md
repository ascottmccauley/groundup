##Theme Features:
* Extremely lightweight and fast framework (unstyled)
* File versioning for better caching
* Separate stylesheets for inlining critical CSS on the first pageload
* Load jQuery (when needed) from Google's CDN with a local fallback
* Adds mod_deflate to .htaccess
* Decluttered Admin
* Prevents WordPress from storing duplicate media.
* Renames additional media sizes according to the sizename (`file-thumbnail.jpg` instead of `file-320x640.jpg`)
* Automatic sitemap.xml and robots.txt creation

###Setup:
* Install node.js
* Clone the git repo into your themes folder - `git clone git://github.com/ascottmccauley/groundup.git`
* Update the node_modules - `npm update`
* Add Bower components - `bower update`
* Run Gulp to compile assets - `gulp`

###Building
#####sourcefiles
* `/src/` - Location for all of the precompiled assets. Gulp will work it's magic and put them in `/assets/`
* `/src/css` - All stylesheets from the css folder will be compiled and minified to `/assets/css`.
* - Bower dependencies must be imported directly into the stylesheet.
* - Child themes are not setup to enqueue the parent css (because of the url rewrite to `/assets/`), The parent SCSS files contain `$include-parent-classes: true !default;` to allow child themes to import the parent styles with `@import "../../../groundup/src/scss/main"`.
* `/src/js` - Gulp concatenates, and minifies js from Bower dependencies and the js folder along with a minified copy of jquery to `/assets/js`
* `/src/fonts` - all fonts from Bower dependencies and the fonts folder are copied to `/assets/fonts/`
* `src/img` - all images from Bower dependencies and the img folder are compressed and copied to `/assets/img`

#####functions
* `/includes/` - All of the ~~fun stuff~~ *functions*
* `/includes/helpers` - Helper functions used throughout the theme
* `/includes/setup` - Initial activation and theme setup options
* `/includes/cleanup` - Cleans up some out of the box WordPress behavior
* `/includes/admin` - Functions specific to the backend or admin_bar
* `/includes/scripts.php` - Loading all the assets [scripts, styles, and cookies]

#####templates
* `/templates` - Templates (surprisedâ€½)
* `/templates/excerpt.php` - can be extended include the post_format or post_type
* `/templates/single.php` - can be extended include the post_format or post_type
* `/templates/meta.php` - time, tags, categories, comment count, image count, and exif info for a post 
* `/templates/comment.php` - Output for a single comment
